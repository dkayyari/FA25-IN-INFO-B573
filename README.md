## Description

This project analyzes a DNA sequence from a FASTA file using Python. It includes reading the sequence, generating its reverse complement, and calculating nucleotide frequencies across kilobase intervals. The goal is to practice Python programming in a bioinformatics context.
## Required Files

- Assignment2_intro_to_python.py – Python script containing all steps
- chr1_GL383518v1_alt.fa – FASTA file with the DNA sequence
- Assignment2_intro_to_python.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook version (optional, for interactive use)
## Required packages
- Python Python 3.13.5
- No external libraries needed (uses built-in Python functions)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running interactively)
## steps for execution
Option 1: Run in Jupyter Notebook
- Open Jupyter Notebook
- Make sure both files are in the same folder
- In a notebook cell, type:
%run Assignment2_intro_to_python.py
- Press Shift + Enter to execute

  ## output summary
- 10th and 758th letters of the DNA sequence
- 79th letter and 500th–800th segment of the reverse complement
- Nucleotide counts for the first kilobase
- Counts and sums for all kilobases
- Alerts for kilobases with unexpected base totals

  ### Notes
- The script uses emojis and bullet points to make output readable
- Case-insensitive counting ensures accuracy
- Discrepancies in kilobase sums are explained in comments
- Ideal for learning Python and bioinformatics basics
